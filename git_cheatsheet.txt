Some more notes on using github within this project ...

- To start a new branch ...
1. You need to pull from the remote (i.e. github) the most recent version of the remote master
        - this refreshes your local master with the current state of the code, and therefore brings in all the changes made by others
        - In pycharm, you can do this by changing the branch to 'master', and clicking VCS -> Git -> Pull
        - Or on the command line, run the following ...
        git checkout master
        git pull --rebase origin master
2. Now that your local master is updated, you can create a new branch ..
        - In pycharm, go to 'VCS -> Git -> Branches' then select '+ New branch'
        - On the command line ...
        git branch <name-of-new-branch>
3. Checkout that branch ...
        - In pycharm when you created that branch, it automatically checks it out
        - On the command line ...
        git checkout <name-of-new-branch>
3.a. On the command line you will also need to point the new local branch at a location on the remote ...
        git push --set-upstream origin <name-of-branch>
4. Write some code
5. Commit back to local repository
        - In pycharm 'VCS -> Commit'
        - On the command line ...
        git commit -a -m 'Some description of what you've done'
6. Push your changes up to the remote so that others can see what you're doing on your branch (and possibly get some help)
        - In pycharm 'VCS -> Git -> Push'
        - On command line ...
        git push
7. When you're happy that your branch works and can be committed back to the remote, you can commit / push so that
        everything is up to date, and then issue a 'pull request'


1. On the github webpage https://github.com/claretandy/wcssp_casestudies hit 'Clone or download', and copy the url

2. In a terminal, cd to a directory that you want to store the code in (e.g. ~/github ), then type the follwoing code into the terminal

git clone <URL copied from step 1>

# The following creates a new branch:
git branch <name of a new branch>

# The following makes the new branch active:
git checkout <name of new branch>

# Link the local branch to an upstream branch
git push --set-upstream origin myfirstbranch

# The following gives you a summary of what branch is being used:
git status

3. Write some code!
If this is the first time, you will need to setup your conda environment - go to step 6!

4. Commit code to local repository

4.a. Add any new files that you have created
git add <my new file>

4.b. Commit the changes to the local repository
git commit -a -m 'A simple description of the changes'

4.c. Push the local branch to an upstream branch
git push

4.d. Go to the git website, find your branch, and issue a pull request for Andy to merge your code with the master

5. Once you've done this, you can delete the branch on github, then create a new branch and do something else!


6. Setup conda environment
- Download miniconda from hre - http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html
- Create a new conda environment ...
conda create --name wcssp --python=3.6
- Activate that environment
conda activate wcssp
- Now install iris and other packages (-c option specifies the 'channel'; -n option specifies the environment to install it in) ...
conda install -n wcssp -c conda-forge iris
